***Remember to always turn down the sound when running a project!!!!***

**Project Overview**

This project is a simple 3D ball control game where the user can control the movement and jumping of the ball via the keyboard. The project includes features such as obstacles, sound triggers and color changes, and is designed to... aims to complete this assignment.

**Main Features**

*Ball movement and jump control*: at the beginning of the game, the player can press the spacebar to start the game and use the J key to jump. Jumping can be performed an infinite number of times and the ball will move towards the end at a fixed speed by default.

*Ball color change*: By pressing the C key, the color of the ball will change randomly.

*Success Trigger Sound*: When the ball reaches the specified position (X value is 32), the ball will stop and play the success sound.

*Collision Detection and Reset*: When the ball collides with an object marked as an obstacle, it will reset back to the starting position. It's actually kinda hard


**The four interactions include**

1. the physical interaction of the ball itself: the ball is able to perform jumps and power-based landings

2. the interaction between the ball and obstacles: the ball can interact with obstacles and return to the origin when it touches them.

3. ball-sound interaction: sound will be played when the ball reaches the destination (x=32).

4. ball-key interaction (1): the ball can be activated by the spacebar.

5. ball-key interaction (2): the ball can jump with J.

6. Interaction between ball and color: the ball can change color randomly by pressing C.
